Value stocks perform better during periods of high inflation, growth stocks when inflation is low. Stocks tend to be more volatile when inflation is higher. In theory, stocks should offer some protection against inflation, as a company's revenues and profits should rise with inflation after an adjustment period. But the reality is not so easy. However, the differential impact of inflation on stocks tends to increase stock market volatility and the risk premium. High inflation has historically been correlated with lower stock returns.",

First, you have to buy stocks either at the end of a bear market or at the beginning of a bull market. This is why bear markets are very beneficial for all investors. You can always continue to buy stocks in a bull market. It is certainly reasonable to use Dollar-cost averaging as well. Second, you need to sell stocks as close to the top as possible. It's easy to say, but hard to do. The most important thing is that you don't buy at the exact top all at once. Unfortunately, many tend to make this mistake. This has led many to stop investing at all and miss out on huge profits.",
